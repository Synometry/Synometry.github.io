[**Options Contracts**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) (or just "*Options*") are a financial instrument in which one party agrees to buy or sell to another party, under some condition of time or the underlying price. This practice allows for speculative investments on the movement of a stock at higher degrees than simply buying long or selling short. In addition, it is a useful tool for protecting one's portfolio from volatility or sudden downturns. Analysis can provide useful information to non-options traders in the form of volatility sentiment ([IV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp))

## Options Fundamentals
Party B begins by writing a contract and selling it to Party A. The contract represents a promise for Party B to buy or sell (depending on whether the contract is a [*call*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) or a [*put*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp)) 100 shares of a specified underlying stock at an agreed-upon strike price and expiration. This sale only occurs if the contract is exercised.

A contract may only be exercised when the underlying security reaches the strike price, or goes beyond it - (higher for call options; lower for put options). Regardless of the price at expiration, An exercised option's shares change hands at its strike price.


## Examples
There are two types of options contracts: Calls and Puts.
### Call
1. I buy an options contract for SPY at a strike price of $370 expiring in 10 days. The contract's price is listed at $12.76. Because the contract is for 100 shares, I will be paying $12.76 x 100 = $1,276.00 for the single contract. The SPY is currently at $365.
1. If I exercised the contract immediately, I'd stand to lose the premium in addition to purchasing 100 shares of SPY for $370 when it is actually trading at $365, netting me a loss of ($370 - $365 + $12.76) * 100 = more than I'd prefer. Thus as most options traders do, I do not exercised immediately.
1. The SPY moves up to $375. If I exercised now I pay $370 for shares that currently go for $375. My net gain/loss would turn out to be ($375 - $370 - $12.76) * 100 shares = still negative. I decide to hold with the expecation the SPY will continue to rise.
1. 10 days have passed and the SPY has not risen any further, instead sinking below where it was when I purchased the call option. Exercising the contract would be a nonsensical move, so I just let it expire. My position netted me a loss of $1276 dollars. :(

## European vs. American
European options and American options differ in when the holding party is allowed to exercise their contracts. American options contracts can be exercised at any time, whereas the European variety may only be exercised at expiration.

## Glossary
- <u>Strike Price</u>: The price at which the option contract is considered "*at the money*" (ATM). Depending on the type of contract, passing this price may be labeled as either "*out of the money*" or "*in the money*".
- <u>Underlying</u>: Options contracts are for shares of one ticker, the underlying stock.
- <u>DTE</u>: "Days Till Expiry", "Days To Expiration", etc. is shorthand for the amount of days until a given contract's expiration.
- <u>Premium</u>: The cost of an options contract. Usually listed as 1/100th of the amount you will pay for one contract as the contracts are for 100 shares of the underlying.
